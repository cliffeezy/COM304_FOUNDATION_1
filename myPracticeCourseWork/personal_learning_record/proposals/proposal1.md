# Council Proposal 1 - Hot Desking

## Explanation of this proposal

- Hot desking is a type of work arrangement that allows employees to use any available desk/workspace in an office or shared workspace environment. Hot desking is most commonly used in modern-day, flexible work environments because mployees do not have assigned desks, allowing them to choose a workspace based on their needs each day, which accommodates hybrid and remote work styles.
- Without strategies like hot desking, businesses may end up with many empty desks on a daily basis, while they still have to pay for renting a large office space and covering overhead costs.
- Two-thirds of desks are unused, and just over a quarter of people come into offices. Attendance drops 12% on Fridays — a scary statistic for companies that pay a lot of office rent.
- One of the basic purposes — and advantages — of hot desking is that it optimizes how your team uses the physical office space. Rather than having numerous empty desks while a significant part of the workforce is working remotely, the available desks in the office can be put to maximum use. Here, you can check how much office space you need.
