## Personal Notes and research following this session

- An Abacus is one of the earliest examples of a counting device. It was used to count big numbers through the use of beads on rods and each bead represented a value like tens and ones. An abacus has had an influence on computing today since it laid out the blueprint the calculators and after that computers. The Beads on an abacus are also equivalent to bits on a computer since through the use of using two different positions (up/down and 1/0) they are capable of saving and portraying numbers.
