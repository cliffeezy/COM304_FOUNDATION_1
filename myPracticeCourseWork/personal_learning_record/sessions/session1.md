## Personal Notes and research following this session

- An Abacus is one of the earliest examples of a counting device. It was used to count big numbers through the use of beads on rods and each bead represented a value like tens and ones. An abacus has had an influence on computing today since it laid out the blueprint the calculators and after that computers. The Beads on an abacus are also equivalent to bits on a computer since through the use of using two different positions (up/down and 1/0) they are capable of saving and portraying numbers.
- The waterfall Model is a linear sequential flow. In which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of software implementation. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete. The waterfall approach does not define the process to go back to the previous phase to handle changes in requirement. The waterfall approach is the earliest approach that was used for software development.
- Agile is based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams.It can be used with any type of the project, but it needs more involvement from the customer and to be interactive. Also, it can be used when the customer needs to have some functional requirement ready in less than three weeks.
- A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!

## Exercises and results

- After making a github account with a simple username we were asked to make a fork through the followin steps; Make your way to the repository at https://github.com/gallenc/COM304_FOUNDATION_1/ and press the fork button. <img width="1373" height="903" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c6fc2a8-09e9-4861-8ae9-0bc8efb6dfd0" />
