## Personal Notes and research following this session

- An operating system is a collection of programs that helps maintain the hardware and software sources in the computer. In other words, They offer a set of utilities that make it easier for the user to navigate their way through a computer.
- Once installed, an operating system relies on a large library of device drivers to tailor its services to the specific hardware environment. For example, every application could make a common call to a storage device. The OS receives that call and uses the corresponding driver to translate the call into actions, or commands, needed for the underlying hardware on that specific computer.
