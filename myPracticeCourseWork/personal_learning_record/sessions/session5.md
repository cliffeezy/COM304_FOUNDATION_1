# Session 5

## Topics covered

- Assembly Code
- Subroutines & Stacks
- Interrupts

## Personal Notes and research following this session

- The Program Counter points to the next instruction in memory.
- The Link Register points the last instruction in memory.
- The Stack Pointer
- Link Register 4 is value 1

- An Interrupt is when a perpipheral sends a signal to interrupt whatever the CPU is doing. 
- Interrupts can happen when doing stuff like typing on a keyboard.
- The interrupt controller is in charge of mapping each interrupt to a different subroutine.

## Exercises and results

- We had to modify an assembler program to display different numbers. The first 2 lines create constants and hold the addresses of the segment counters.
