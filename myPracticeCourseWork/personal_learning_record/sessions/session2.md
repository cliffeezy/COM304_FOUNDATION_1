## Personal Notes and research following this session
*Which class sessions and personal research refers to technology in this proposal. Link to examples.*

- Gates have two or more inputs, except a NOT gate which has only one input. All gates have only one output. Usually the letters A, B, C and so on are used to label inputs, and Q is used to label the output. On this page the inputs are shown on the left and the output on the right.
- A truth table is a good way to show the function of a logic gate. It shows the output states for every possible combination of input states. The symbols 0 (false) and 1 (true) are usually used in truth tables. The example truth table shows the inputs and output of an AND gate.
- A NOT gate can only have one input and the output is the inverse of the input. A NOT gate is also called an inverter. The output Q is true when the input A is NOT true: Q = NOT A.   <img width="136" height="74" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4e77f29-1989-4ece-8640-78091c479f72" />
- An AND gate can have two or more inputs, its output is true if all inputs are true. The output Q is true if input A AND input B are both true: Q = A AND B.   <img width="136" height="74" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23797c36-681b-41d3-aefb-4ea3e70ae7ed" />
- An OR gate can have two or more inputs, its output is true if at least one input is true. The output Q is true if input A OR input B is true (or both of them are true): Q = A OR B.
